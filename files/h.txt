
Nothing lasts. 
We're all in this common circumstance of 
impermanence together. 

Why be anything but kind to one another?


Imagine that everything ordinary is suddenly as precious as 
it would be on the last day of life. To see this moment 
clearly, you only need to notice how fleeting everything 
is—and how perfect.
